I joined the club in 2020 and due to the pandemic, we promoted online meetings, and digital content production. Instagram was the tool used to spread our digital content, with 109 posts created since its creation date. We enhanced and strengthened institutional internacionalization, and helped students develop their English. For our research we were honered with Best Project at High School Level in a state wide science fair (Fecintec), leading us to one state wide presentation and two national science fairs, from which we received R$ 4,200.00.

An online course with the mission of empowering students with the skills and confidence necessary to become future leaders, problem solvers and innovators through quantum education. Taught by MIT Scientists (other universities too!) and Sponsored by IBM, this is the only online course about quantum computing open worldwide for high school students. QubitxQubit excits me every week with lectures and lab sessions and I take advantage of these moments to learn as much as I can about the field I want to specialize in. I even started sharing my notes with the worldwide web: <a href="https://luispengler.github.io/site/html/org-pages/quantum-computing.html">https://luispengler.github.io/site/html/org-pages/quantum-computing.html</a> also here&rsquo;s a link to my first semester grades: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X8zmCD8W1R8TCljNCOMkUOpgvaeku9UF/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X8zmCD8W1R8TCljNCOMkUOpgvaeku9UF/view?usp=sharing</a>

Yo Cientificx is a project focused on scientific dissemination. It is an Instagram and presencial project focused on bringing academic level science to high school students. One of our biggest accomplishments was to hold webinars with some famous Brazilian scientists, who represented minorities, with the goal to inspire these same high school students that are from these minorities. Another big accomplishment of ours was having 43 people enrolled in a 11 week course about scientific methodology and how to develop your own project. Throughout my time in the team I was able to interview people - with whom I would like to work with - for livestreams and Instagram videos.

Olympiad League of Astronomy is a project focused on astronomy dissemination. We have 1,354 followers on Instagram and our recent youtube channel has 175 subscribers. However the project started as a webpage. We offer preparation for Astronomy Olympiads, be it national or international (OBA, MOBFOG, OLAA, IOAA), as well as having anything (exams, worklists, books, handouts, articles, guides) you will need to study for them.

In the cycle I had the opportunity to be a mentor on, we had 40 students, whom went from almost zero level of English to a conversational level in 20 weeks. As a mentor I would say I had a really good opportunity to develop my soft skills, not only in order to communicate with other mentors and mentees, but to create the material, give the classes and practice with my mentee each week. In the period of mentoring, I developed 205 slide pages to auxiliate the teaching process.

I volunteered a month in auxiliating a physics teacher with 3 physics classes (about 40 students each), and received a scholarship for the following semester to continue the work. The students participated throughout this period, having questions regarding activities, and list of exercises cleared up. Besides the test reviews I helped them with.

<li>Prompt: Which major would you like to pursue and why? Even if you are undecided, tell us why. Please provide details. (250 - 500 words)
My interest in Physics actually started with Chemistry. As a 6-year-old boy, I would ask my dad to print me a new periodic table every time I ran out of ways to set it up. But truth be told: at that time all I ever wanted to do was learn anything I found interesting. In Physics, one can never run out of curiosity and my inner-childhood never allowed me to do that. Throughout the years, I have been amazed by what humanity was able to do by just mastering Physics. How does an airplane that weighs 440 tons fly anyway?
When I was 14, I was surprised how Linux-based operating systems made all the crappy computers I ever owned seem like they could have a new life. Simply learning how I could use this OS with more efficiency helped me see the bigger picture. Just like operating systems, computers are a tool. And the better a tool becomes, the more efficiently we are able to solve our unique set of problems. Be it improving chaotic system simulations for the weather forecasts or providing assistance in solving the united nations&rsquo; Zero Hunger Goal.
Quantum Computers will be the way to go in the future, at least for simulations (which we can use to solve the worldâs biggest problems). A cool thing about this growing field is that it is really multidisciplinary. Having a degree in Physics and Computer Science would help me approach Quantum Computers in two distinct ways. Besides, I have individual interests in both fields that I could pursue in the future.</li>

/You can see nobody was ready for this screenshot, but this same group of people used to meet throughout the whole year of 2021. This project is called Let&rsquo;s Bora and it is a conversational meeting group, so that we can practice English. That day, we were just having fun while playing UNO on telegram, and playing Gartic Phone. This image appeals to me because it reminds me how much we can accomplish when we are together. All of us improved our English, and I am sure we could not have done if we had nobody to listen to or no one to laugh with.

In Junior High, I received 11 certificates indicating great academic performance, 7 of them being either class valedictorian or stating a GPA greater than 9.5. But at the end of middle school, about 8th-9th grade, my house was not in a good mood. My parents always fought a lot, but prior to their divorce, there were constant fights each week that a few times made my mom leave the house or we (me, my mother, and my two younger siblings) go to a distant police station dedicated to cases concerning violence against women. They got divorced in February of 2019. On September 15h of 2020, I was hospitalized for a disease I still carry, but wasn&rsquo;t identified until this event. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is the disease, and a rare one. But after removing my spleen it isn&rsquo;t much of a trouble. I started developing a passion for FOSS (free and open-source software) and as part of that journey, I&rsquo;ve been writing my own website/blog <a href="https://luispengler.github.io/site/html/README.html">https://luispengler.github.io/site/html/README.html</a>. I presented a scientific initiation in High School (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXh0zFwdwKo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXh0zFwdwKo</a>).

It was September 15, 2020. I was in a queue to get vaccinated when my nose started bleeding. At that point in my life, my nose would start bleeding almost every day. However, this one occasion was special, as it was the first time I really needed to go to the hospital for it to stop bleeding.
As a result of needing a hospital to refrain my nose from bleeding, I ended up staying there for about three weeks, being submitted to different exams. With the examination, the doctor was determining the best course of action to take from there. As a consequence, it was decided I was to remove my spleen.
They tried explaining to me I would still have a normal life, and etc. I said I understood it, but I kept denying the fact that I was scared. Really scared this time. What if something was to go wrong? Besides, living the rest of my life requiring vaccination every 5 years wasn&rsquo;t something I was willing to go for either.
After those three weeks, I was home, resting and getting ready to take the surgery. Still scared, but I managed to hide it from my mother and the people closest to me. Though, one night before going to the hospital again, I started crying like that was the last day of my life. I decided to tell my good friend Raquel what I was feeling, and after a moment I managed to put it together.
I woke up the next day after the surgery, a bright day: October 23, 2020. At first, it was hard to do anything, but I recovered just fine. Sometimes I keep wondering why I felt so frightened that day. Perhaps if my life ever gets threatened once again, I can remember how well everything went that day.

New friends, youtube videos, and software were some things that helped me learn the English language. I would spend the afternoon talking in English with my Turkish friend, Berkay. At the earliest days of our calls on the phone, I was- how would you describe? âJust smile and wave, boysâ. Now, I have a friend for life.
The people from the English club were also on my list of new friends. There is a passion for the English language: A group of students ready to take their English experiences to other people. I soon became one of the staff members, and it helped me not only with English but also to develop my leadership skills.
Even during the pandemic, my friend Raquel and I had work to do. We hosted four live streams in English and every time, we would just go crazy, having calls that lasted hours, just to prepare for being host again.
I can say that learning English has enabled me to broaden my perspectives in many different ways, but above all, it has been responsible for the development of a better sense of myself and of what I want for life.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Please explain why you chose the session(s) above, including your reasoning for how you ranked each session. (100 Words)
I chose IST as the first option because I carry a huge passion for physics, molecular biology, chemistry, astronomy, engineering. I have also worked at electrical engineering labs, and researched, mainly in the English language area. Multidisciplinarity is a great deal for me, as I am modeling my way towards working in the quantum computing field. I also considered SGC because parts of working in this field require you to think about how such an innovative and expensive machine can be used to solve the world&rsquo;s biggest problems.</li>

<li>SHORT ANSWER: We know students have many options for academic enrichment programs to which to apply. Please explain why you chose to apply for YYGS specifically AND why you would be a great fit for the program. What will you contribute to YYGS, and what do you hope to take away from YYGS and bring back to impact your community? (100 words)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Partially because what I intend to do in the future takes contributions from many areas, I highly value multidisciplinarity and I feel at home when I am in a place I can learn from math to global politics.
I fit in the program because I am an open-minded person, collaborative, and I can contribute to the global diversity as a Brazilian student.
I hope to take as some of my outcomes, more impactful ideas to contribute to my projects regarding my school/country community where I play a big role, and greater respect for the different cultures portraited in YYGS.

Many brands that design and manufacture laptops or other electronic devices aren&rsquo;t as focused on the consumer as you might think, and some might even use planned obsolescence as a business plan. However, framework is different.
This company is working on proving that you don&rsquo;t need to make ugly, heavy and thick laptops to call them repairable, neither revoke your rights on the product you manufacture to make it self-repairable.
By open-sourcing their firmware, software, and hardware components, they give the user back his freedom, and stimulate privacy-conserving practices. As a bigger result, they create a community of non and tech experts who love framework&rsquo;s products.

Sometimes when you are part of a group that does something interesting, you think everybody else knows what you are doing. But that&rsquo;s not the reality. Imagine you are part of a research group focused on decreasing noise in quantum computers. &ldquo;What does noise have to do with computers?&rdquo; (One might ask) And then you decide it is time people know what the heck a quantum computer is.
First, you need to understand that quantum computers are not devices that will help you send an email to your teacher, or being able to play 8K videos in 10 different monitors at the same time. No, quantum computers are not supposed to be a replacement for your normal computer. For the sake of understanding, let&rsquo;s say normal computers are classical computers.
Quantum computers have the name quantum because they use the properties of quantum mechanics to solve problems, and classical computers use the properties of classical physics to solve problems.
And the kind of problems quantum computers may be able to solve in the future is incredible: Search for life in other planets, global hunger, climate change, cyber security, vaccine development, drug discovery, and many other problems. But those problems will only be able to be solved with a quantum computer in the long-term quantum computing. For now, we need to get satisfaction by being able to simulate quantum monte-carlo, take advantage of quantum key distribuition, and play quantum chess.
Quantum computers have a huge advantage on classical computers when we are solving problems that involve too much searching or testing for classical computers to do quickly, problems that require secure encryption, or problems that require simulating quantum mechanical systems. Remember, they are not a replacement for classical computers.
If quantum computers use the properties of quantum mechanics, then what are these properties? There are 3 properties that are used the most: superposition, interference, and entanglement. All of these will sound weird to you, but with a simple ice cream analogy, I can facilitate your understanding.
Superposition is like when you go to an ice cream store. There are only two ice cream flavors in this particular store: chocolate, and strawberry. Until you say it out loud &ldquo;I want a chocolate ice cream&rdquo;, the person taking orders will not know which one do you want. Your ice cream will be in a superposition of chocolate AND strawberry, meaning that for a moment, you actually had an ice cream that tasted two different flavors at the same time! But because this is not possible, when you finally decide which flavor you want, your magical ice cream becomes a simple chocolate one OR a strawberry one.
Interference is like when you are choosing an ice cream flavor plus an ice cream topping. Lets suppose you only have 4 toppings: caramel sauce, blueberry sauce, lemon sauce, and vanilla sauce. The first two (caramel sauce, and blueberry sauce) are only allowed to go with the chocolate ice cream, and the last two (lemon sauce, and vanilla sauce) can only be on top of a strawberry ice cream. In reality, you only need to tell your ice cream topping to know your ice cream flavor. If you order an ice cream with lemon sauce topping, a strawberry ice cream will come up + this lemon sauce topping.
Entanglement can also be explained in an easy way. Imagine you go to this same ice cream store, even though it only has two ice cream flavors and four toppings, it is the place your best friend and you love going to the most. You go there so often, the attendant already know what you usually order. If you just tell them you will want the usual, they will know what you and your friend is going to eat. There is a correlation between the command &ldquo;I will have the usual&rdquo; and the final result (the ice cream you and your friend get at the end).
The last three paragraphs are only simple analogies about complex ideas. You will not be a university professor just by understanding them, but I hope I made myself clear in explaining the essentials of a quantum computer, what we will get if we continue developing them, and the basics behind those strange computers.
