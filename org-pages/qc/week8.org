* Week 8 (qubit by qubit)
** Recap
*** Review:
+ The Quantum Circuit Model is broken down in three parts
  - The initial state
  - The computation
  - Measurements

    **** COMPLETE THIS LATER, YOU FAMILY IS ANNYOING

** Measurement
+ When we measure something, we are basically asking if it is in a \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state
+ Quantum measurements operate in terms of probabilities.
+ Our goal is to predict the result of our measurements
