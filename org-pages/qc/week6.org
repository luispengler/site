* Week 6 (Qubit by Qubit)
** RECAP
*** Review: States and Gates
 + X - 180 rotation around the X-axis
 + Z - 180 rotation around the Z-axis
 + H - creates a superposition

** Math for Quantum: Qubits
+ With math we can predict the outcomes, without necessarily having to memorize each one of them.
+ *Superconducting*, *Trapped Ions*, *Diamond NV Centers*, *Photonics* are different kind of qubits, and math is the language common to all of them!
+ *Linear Algebra* is used in many algorithms, like grover's algorithm.

*** Qubits
+ \(|0\rangle\), \(|1\rangle\), \(|+\rangle\), \(|-\rangle\) are ways to represent them.
+ *But* in an unequal superposition, we need a better way to represent contributions.
+ That is why we will use *two numbers in the form of a vector.*
+ 0 state is represented as \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}
+ 1 state is represented as \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}
+ It is worth mentioning that the top number represents the component of \(|0\rangle\) and the bottom, the component of \(|1\rangle\).
\begin{bmatrix} |0\rangle\ component\\|1\rangle\ component\end{bmatrix}
+ But how do we represent

*** Superpostions
+ To represent equal superpositions, we just need to add the two vectors:
  \[\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}\]

+ To get to an unequal superposition, we need to apply some gates to get there and it is the goal of a field called quantum algorithm design

*** Normalization
+ The vectors representing quantum states must be *normalized*, which means having a *lenght of 1*
+ The radius of the Bloch Sphere is 1, so as all quantum states lie on the Bloch sphere, they must all have a length of 1.

+ [ ] Step 1: Write the state in the vector form \begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}
+ [ ] Step 2: Find the length of the state as sqrt((a^2) + (b^2))
+ [ ] Step 3: If the length is 1, the state is normalized. If not, divide the state by its length to get the normalized state.
  - Normalized form of the state = \[1/\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}\]

*** Examples to help with normalization:
+ Remember that all of this comes from *linear algebra*

** Phase
+ Subtract the following states:
 \[\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}\]
+ The sign between \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) is called phase.
+ The phase diferences lead to interference (more coming soon)
+ There are more relations in phase that won't be addressed in this course because they require *complex numbers*
