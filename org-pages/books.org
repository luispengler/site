*** Description
"A mysterious island. An abandoned orphanage. A strange collection of vintage photography. It all waits to be discovered in Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, a spine-tingling YA fantasy illustrated with haunting black-and-white photography. The hardcover edition spent more than 52 consecutive weeks on the New York Times Best-Seller List. This beautifully designed paperback edition features an exclusive interview with author Ransom Riggs and a sneak preview of the upcoming Miss Peregrine novel."
