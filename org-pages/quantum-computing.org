* This collection
This notes page is about all my notes taken throughout this whole course.
+ What is this course?
  - This is "Introduction to Quantum Computing", made by The Coding School (TCS) as a result of a partnership with IBM Quantum.
+ Who is this for?
  - Mainly High School students. But if you are not a High School student anymore, you can check out this [[https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/][course]] instead.
+ How do I apply?
  - Personally, the first time I heard of this was through a friend and he showed me [[https://www.instagram.com/the_coding_school/][their instagram page]] (where they made the course's annoucement)
  - So I would say, wait for it to open again (usually around august each year). However, I am not 100% sure if they are planning on opening new classes - why not tho?
  - The course goes from September until April (at least 22' was)
