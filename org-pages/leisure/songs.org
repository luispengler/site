* Getting started
You are probably wondering... One more list of things? The answer is yes, but that's the wrong question! Why am I doing this? To simply put this: I wanna learn guitar again and don't wanna get unmotivated.

I already played acoustic guitar before, even electric. But perhaps I might've gotten slightly unmotivated to play as time passed by. And every time I wanna show my guitar skills I've got no songs to play! So I should also build my music repertoire
