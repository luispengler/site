Another compilation of arroverse viewing order you can find on the net...\\
=Note 1= As much as I'd like to make this a mainstream project, I can't. This webpage's only purpose is of helping me check my progress while watching arrowverse.

=Note 2= This viewing order comes from an amazing open-source project. Check it out: [[https://arrowverse.info/][arrowverse.info]]
