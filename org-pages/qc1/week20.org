* Week 20 - Quantum Computing & Beyond
** Quantum Beyond Computing
+ Superconduction was discovered in 1911, when Kammerligh Onnes cooled mercury down to 3K and it conducted electricity with no resistance
+ However, a full theory of superconductivity was only created in 1957 (BCS theory) -- by means of quantum mechanics
+ SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference device) are sensible to tiny magnetic field produced by our brain -- this was quantum 1.0
+ We've gotten to quantum 2.0 when we improved those devices and were able to visualize quantum properties in these circuits

** Quantum 1.0 & Quantum 2.0
+ In quantum 1.0, we don't need quantum to understand what is happening, but it is there

*** What is quantum about lasers?
+ The color the laser emits corresponds to its energy (discretization)

** The Uncertainty Principle
+ A consequence of wave-particle duality
+ The more exactly we can point out the position, the less exact we can express the wavelength
+ It is also applied to energy and time
+ We engineer around this fundamental idea!

*** Sensing Gravitational Waves
+ Using "squeezed" states at LIGO

** Quantum Tunneling
+ Particles end up in places that they shouldn't be allowed classicaly, like crossing a wall
+ That's how we can see through a window, or hear that lousy neighbour!
+ Tunneling is easiest when the barrier is thin
+ Fun fact: Quantum tunneling makes the stars shine -- The energy limit required for two atoms to fuse is like a barrier
+ Quantum tunneling is also used in sensors: Scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
+ In STM, we move a very sharp tip over the sample we want to image, it measures how many electrons are tunneling and gives you a picture of this sample
