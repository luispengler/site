* Week 23 - VQE and its Applications
+ We can combine quantum computing with classical computing to solve problems
+ Today we will look in chemisty simulation and finance

** Chemestry
+ Understanding how a molecule is composed and structured, you can use this knowledge to explain its function and properties
+ We can reverse engineer this process, by creating something that you want to behave in a certain way
+ The problem is that finding a structure is hard. Finding its composition is easy
+ Quantum computers will help us find these structures!
+ Bigger molecule = more calculation = more computing power

** Case Study: Protein folding
+ As the size of the protein increases, the number of possible solutions for its structure rises exponentially
+ One method of developing vaccines is to disrupt the process of a virus' spike protein from binding to human cells
+ In order to find a molecule that can stop this process, we need to try /many/ simulations
+ In pharmaceuticals, you're dealing with large proteins with thousands of atoms
+ To experimentally determine a protein structure, you use x-ray or electron diffraction, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and Cyro electron microscopy
+ To computationall determine a protein structure, you use molecular dynamics simulations on a supercomputer, crowdsourced simulations (folding@home), and artificial intelligence
+ Why to use quantum? Quantum systems are naturally discrete, so we can map the different possible solutions to the optimization problem to discrete quantum levels
+ Because of current hardware errors, results aren't reliable, therefore we use VQE to shift some of the work to classical computers

** VQE cycle to find protein structure
1. CPU receives atoms in the protein
2. CPU decides which structure to try out and sends to QPU
3. QPU measures the energy of the structure
4. QPU sends results of the measurement to CPU
5. CPU decides if this structure minimizes energy - if yes, solved. If not, repeat the process
