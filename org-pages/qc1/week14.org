* Week 14 - Math of Two-Qubit Circuits
** Recap
*** Vector and matrices
+ X gate:
  \[\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\]

+ Z gate:
  \[\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & -1\end{bmatrix}\]

+ H gate:
  \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & -1\end{bmatrix}\]

*** Multi-Qubit circuits
+ You can have single-qubit gates (ones that are applied to one qubit only)
+ You can have controlled gates (applied to multipled qubits at a time)

** Introduction to 2-Qubit circuits & indexing
+ For individual circuits, writing a state in ket notation is super easy: \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\)
+ For 2-qubit circuits, just put those together: \(|01\rangle\) or \(|10\rangle\). You may also find \(|0\rangle|1\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle|0\rangle\)
+ The index to be used is first (at left) q1 and at right q0: \(|q1q0\rangle\). This is known as right indexing.

** Vector for multi-qubits states
+ The upper part is the amount of \(|0\rangle\) contribution
+ The lower part is the amount of \(|1\rangle\) contribution
+ As an example, a \(|0\rangle\) state:
\[\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\]
+ We will have four parts now. Representing the components of \(|00\rangle\), \(|01\rangle\), \(|10\rangle\), and \(|11\rangle\)
+ As an example, a \(|10\rangle\) state:
\[\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}\]

** Applying gates to Multi-Qubit circuits
+ For a single qubit: (Matrix) * (Initial state) = final state
+ The math can be the same, but the matrix will be huge.. so let's try to predict it

** Predicting final states
1. Find the ket representation of the final state by applying the gates in the circuit
2. Fill in the vector based on the elements in the ket

** Math of the CX gate
+ CX gate also has a matrix representation:
\[\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\]
+ Lets apply this gate to a \(|00\rangle\) state
\[\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\cdot \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\]

** The Math of Entanglement
+ It generally is \[|q1q2\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)\]
+ You can see the sight of dependence in there

** Tensor Product Introduction
+ Could you combine two separete vectors to get a 4x1 vector?
+ Ofc, we call this mathematical operation a tensor product
*** Example
+ Qubit 0 is in state \(|q0\rangle\) = \(|1\rangle\) = \[\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\]
+ Qubit 1 is in state \(|q1\rangle\) = \(|0\rangle\) = \[\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\]
+ The math basically is:
\(|q1q0\rangle\) = \(|q1\rangle\otimes |q0\rangle\) = \(|0\rangle\otimes |1\rangle\) = \[\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\otimes \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\]
