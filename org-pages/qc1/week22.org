* Week 22 - Types of Qubits and Intro to Near-Term Algorithms
** Superconducting Qubits
*** Pros
+ It's on a chip
+ Microwave technology is well developed
+ High quality gates and readout
*** Cons
+ Require cooling to mK temperatures
+ Loss to substrate material
+ Need bigger dilution

** Photonic Qubits
*** Pros
+ Room temperature
+ Compatible with existing fabrication infrastructure
+ Uses photonic technology which is well-developed
+ Low single-photon error rates
*** Cons
+ Entanglement is difficult (photons don't interact with each other easily)
+ Single photon generation is unreliable
+ Superconducting detectors require cooling to K temperatures

** Guest
*** Rydberg Atom Qubits
+ Relativily new type of qubit
+ Each atom is a qubit
+ We use the shell of the electron to identify different states
+ The types of atoms used are called neutral atom: atoms with only one atom in the valence
+ If  the valence electron is where it should be, it's \[|0\rangle\] if it's not, it's \[|1\rangle\]
*** How do you hold atoms in the right locations?
+ Optical tweezers are used to hold the atoms in place. It is even possible to create an array of atoms
*** Pros
+ Large number of qubits
+ Customizable qubit locations
+ High decoherence time
*** Cons
+ Physical crowding limits single-qubit gates
+ High error rates for ~2 qubit gates

** Near-term algorithms
+ Designed to work on NISQ (Noisy Intermidiate-Scale Quantum) technology
+ It is used by leveraging quantum computers alongside classical ones
+ We don't know about advantages in near-term algorithms over classical ones
+ These algortihms are also called hybrid algorithms (bc of quantum + classical)
+ The ultimate goal we can shift more computation into QC, but right now, most of them are done in CC
*** QPU & CPU partnership
1. Quantum Computer: Runs your Quantum Circuit
2. Quantum Computer: Send the results of your circuit to Classical Computer
3. Classical Computer: Figure out how to modify the circuit
4. Classical Computer: Send new-instructions to Quantum Computer
+ Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA)
+ Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

*** Problems VQE and QAOA can solve
+ Constrained Optimization Problems: Find the most optimal solution
+ The Knapsack problem (the backpack problem) is the most famous problem
+ The KP is that you are only allowed to bring one backpack. It is up to you to pack the bag most efficiently, given that you can only carry a certain wight and certain volume
+ You can map the different solutions in discrete values!

** Tunable Quantum Circuits
+ We can implement the possible solutions to different settings of a quantum circuit
+ For our tunable circuits, we will use tunable gates.
+ Tuning the circuit to find the most optimal circuit, it's just tuning these gates
