* About me
Hi, I am Luís Spengler and at the moment I write this I am a Junior High School student, taking electrotechnics vacational program.\\
My interests are in the area of physics (particle physics and quantum mechanics) and computer science, mainly what refers to [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html][free software]].\\
* About this website
** Content
This is the main page of the website, therefore it makes sense to be the center of the webiste. Any action you can perform in the website, has a start in here.\\
At the top header, you can see a collection of links you can click on to be redirected to, you can also check out the portuguese version of it (coming soon!).\\
In "[[https://luispengler.github.io/site/html/org-pages/notes.html][My notes]]" I host several (I will be expanding in the future...) notes on subjects I studied in the past few weeks. It can be a great source of information in the subjects available there :)\\
The other stuff are some lists I host to organize work and leisure time, such as my [[https://luispengler.github.io/site/html/org-pages/ficha.html][mentoring list]] and compiled list on [[https://luispengler.github.io/site/html/org-pages/dc.html][arrowverse]], where I check my progess and a [[https://luispengler.github.io/site/html/org-pages/filmes.html][list of movies]] I watch with my girlfriend in the free time.\\
Other than that, I thank you for visiting this webpage :)\\
